# Face-Tracking
The objective of the program given is to detect object of interest(face) in real time and to keep tracking of the same object in motion.

•	Used OpenCV library for detecting face in real time.

•	Used pretrained XML classifiers for detecting faces and eyes.

•	Using OpenCV, captures the video frames from camera.

•	Reading frames from a camera and then converting to grayscale.

•	Detecting the faces of different sizes and drawing the rectangle.

•	Using OpenCV showing the images in window.
